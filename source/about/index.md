Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a first-year Master's student at Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Before that, I achieved the Bachelor's degree from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC).

My primary research interest lie in the fields of Computer Vision and Multimodality.
